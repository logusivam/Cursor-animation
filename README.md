# Cursor Animation using HTML and CSS

This project demonstrates how to create a custom animated cursor using HTML and CSS. The custom cursor is designed to be a circle that changes its hue as it moves, creating a dynamic and visually engaging effect. This animation enhances the user experience by making cursor interactions more interesting and visually appealing.
